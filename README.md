# Attractnid

##
Attractnid is a four legged robot which can scale metal surfaces. It relies on magnets to attach itself to surfaces and looks like a spider. This repo contains firmware for the Arduino which controls the robot. It includes files for different walking motions and types of responses from the robot, but the files of note are:

* v4/respond_to_input_v4: Code with the most features: optimized walking speed, user control, and heading correction.
* v4/recalibrate_angles: A script which will set all legs to the sides. Can be used to calibrate angle conversion functions.
