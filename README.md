Repo for the code for our climby boiiii

## To Do
* Object to control the legs
* Leg object with two motors, can move "Up", "down", "backward", "forward"
* Leg object should have zeros

* Calibration script (press a button when the sweeping leg is perp to the robot - then we can specify how much we want toe leg to move on either side of that)

* Get servo with more PWM outputs
