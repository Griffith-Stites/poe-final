# Approach
The approach for code

1. Image recognition - output should just be the white and black
2. Blob count - Find the highest concentration of the desired colors
 - This is a form of feature recognition
3. Draw around the biggest blob (or two blobs?)
4. Track the movement of the box around the blob count. If it does something notable, move the bot (Ex: swipe left, move robot left)
